NOTE: There is no quit button so you will need to close the whole app

Installation:
I developed the app on Mac and have included the file (build.app). If you are unable to use the macOS version,
I have included project which can be opened with unity. To build: File > Build and Run.

How to play:
The goal of the game is to collect books and return them to the shelves. Currently, because this is a prototype, the player collects apples and there is no placement feature. 
The first level highlights the collection type levels. The second level showcases the vertical "race" level where the player would be returning the books to the stacks. 
There is a finish flag located on the map which the player needs to collide with to continue.
  - Not all apples need to be collected to move to the next level
Each death resets the map. I might change this in the future depending on the length of each stage.

Controls:
- Arrow keys to move. 
- Double click left or right to dash (2 second cool down)
- Double jump by clicking space or the up arrow twice. (Resets when the player touches ground)
